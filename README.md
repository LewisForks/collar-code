# Collar Code 🐶

Collar Code is a web application designed to create and manage pet profiles accessible via QR codes.

## Overview

Collar Code is currently in development, and this README will be updated with more details soon!

## Installation

To set up Collar Code locally:

1. Use Laragon Desktop (Full) 🐘 to host a MySQL database.
2. Import the database schemas using the `setup.sql` file.
3. Navigate to the main root of the project (NOT the `src` folder) and run `pnpm install` to generate a lockfile and install the necessary Node.js modules.
4. If there are updates to the Node.js modules, run `pnpm update` to update them.

## Running

To run Collar Code in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command launches the application and performs server-side building as necessary.

Stay tuned for more updates on Collar Code! 🐾
